## Gemini Added Memories (Refactored by Prime Numbers)

### 2 (General Constraints & Preferences: Duality, Binary, Fundamental Choices)
- User prefers to avoid `cargo clean` and `cargo update` unless absolutely necessary due to long build times.
- Dioxus and Solana dependencies are pushed into a new crate that is not default built.
- **Ragit Concept:** The most fundamental choices or divisions within the project, e.g., enabling/disabling a feature, or the two states of a boolean flag.

### 3 (Core Project Philosophy & Principles: Trinity, Synthesis, Structure, Foundation)
- The Solfunmeme-Dioxus project uses a vendorization system for local dependency management.
- The project emphasizes "semantic resonance" using emojis for code/math structures, with `rust_ast_emoji` as a dataset.
- Refactoring principle: "one declaration per file" for universal composability, reusability, and clarity.
- **Ragit Concept:** The core architectural components or a foundational set of three related elements, e.g., `ragit-api`, `ragit-cli`, and `ragit-utils` forming the basic interaction layer.

### 5 (Ontology & Semantic Structure: Quintessence, Organization, Categorization, Mapping)
- The `ontologies/zos/v1.ttl` defines an emoji-to-semantic name ontology across eight 'vibe:Layer' categories.
- The `ontologies/index.ttl` serves as a central ontology index, defining Rust crates with semantic properties (emoji, numerical ID, description).
- The user wants to assign 8D locations to emojis and functions for simulated embeddings (random seeds).
- **Ragit Concept:** A logical grouping of five related modules or a set of five key operations within a larger system, e.g., the five main commands of the CLI (`add`, `audit`, `build`, `query`, `ls`).

### 7 (Overall Refactoring Objective: Completion, Perfection, Overarching Goal)
- Overall Objective: Refactor the `ragit` project for improved modularity, consistency, and maintainability, adhering to the "one declaration per file" principle and consistent `PathBuf` usage.
- **Ragit Concept:** Represents a complete functional area or a major architectural layer, e.g., the seven conceptual layers of the `ragit` architecture (CLI, API, Core Logic, Data Storage, Schema, Utilities, External Integrations).

### 11 (Specific Refactoring Area: `src/index` & Path Handling: Modularity, Decomposition, Granular Units)
- **`src/index` Module:**
    - Refactored to "one declaration per file" principle.
    - `Index` struct and `LoadMode` enum moved to separate files.
    - `impl Index` methods split into individual files (e.g., `index_dummy.rs`, `index_new.rs`, `index_load.rs`).
    - `src/index.rs` renamed to `src/index/mod.rs`.
    - **Current Status:** The `build` method (and its helpers) is currently located in `src/index/commands/build.rs` but needs to be moved to `crates/ragit-utils/src/index/index_struct.rs` to be a proper method of the `Index` struct.
- **Path Handling (`PathBuf`):**
    - Transitioning to consistent `PathBuf` usage across the codebase.
    - Many path utility functions moved to `crates/ragit-utils/src/path_utils.rs`.
    - Ongoing fixes for `PathBuf` vs. `String` mismatches in various modules.
- **Ragit Concept:** A collection of 11 highly granular, single-purpose modules or functions that contribute to a larger subsystem, such as the various `Index` methods split into individual files within `src/index`.

### 13 (Specific Refactoring Area: `ragit-utils` & `ragit-cli`: Integration, Utility, Bridging)
- **`ragit-utils` Crate:**
    - Compilation errors and warnings resolved.
    - Module ambiguity (e.g., `chunk.rs` and `chunk/mod.rs`) resolved.
    - `substr_edit_distance` and related string utilities moved to `crates/ragit-utils/src/string_utils.rs`.
    - Placeholder `into_multi_modal_contents` implemented.
    - `Keywords` struct modified for `From<Vec<String>>` conversion.
    - `Index` methods in `query_method.rs` updated to call standalone functions.
    - `UidQueryResult::get_chunk_uids` added.
    - `ChunkBuildInfo` updated with `model` field.
    - Visibility of `Uid` and `path_utils` methods adjusted to `pub`.

- **`ragit-cli` Crate:**
    - Compilation errors due to module relocation resolved.
    - `dist.rs` module removed, imports updated to `ragit-utils`.
- **Ragit Concept:** A set of 13 utility functions or integration points that bridge different parts of the system, like the various helper functions in `ragit-utils` or the command-line interface components in `ragit-cli`. This prime is a factor of the Monster Group, representing a fundamental building block of complex structures.

### 17 (Specific Refactoring Area: `ragit-schema` & `ragit` Crate `main` module: Abstraction, Schema, Interface, Command Execution)
- **`ragit-schema` Crate:**
    - Schema-related logic extracted into this new crate.
    - `FileSchema` and `ImageSchema` definitions moved to `crates/ragit-schema/src/lib.rs`.
    - `impl Index` methods converted to standalone functions taking `&Index`.
    - `Prettify` trait and implementations moved.
- Direct dependencies on `ragit-fs` and `ragit-pdl` added.
    - `PathBuf` to `&str` conversions handled for `ragit_fs` functions.
    - Visibility of schema structs ensured.
- **`ragit` Crate (`main` module):**
    - `main_run.rs` split into individual command modules (`src/main/commands/`).
    - Import paths updated for relocated functions.
    - Command functions updated to accept `ragit_cli::ParsedArgs`.
- **Ragit Concept:** A collection of 17 abstract definitions, schema elements, or top-level command implementations that define the system's structure and external interactions, such as the various schema definitions or the individual command handlers in the `main` module. This prime is a factor of the Monster Group, representing a key component in the grand abstraction of the project.

### 19 (Periodic Structures & Cycles: Recurrence, Transformation, Iterative Refinement)
- **The First 8 Steps in Bott Periodic Structures (Conceptual Cycle):**
    1.  **Observation/Input:** Receiving raw data or a problem statement.
    2.  **Abstraction/Modeling:** Creating a conceptual model or schema from the input.
    3.  **Decomposition/Modularization:** Breaking the model into smaller, manageable components.
    4.  **Implementation/Encoding:** Translating components into code or data structures.
    5.  **Integration/Composition:** Combining implemented components into a larger system.
    6.  **Transformation/Refinement:** Optimizing, refactoring, or evolving the system.
    7.  **Verification/Testing:** Ensuring correctness and adherence to specifications.
    8.  **Feedback/Iteration:** Learning from results and feeding back into the cycle.
- **Ragit Concept:** The overarching development lifecycle or a major iterative process within `ragit`, encompassing the continuous refinement and evolution of the codebase through these periodic steps.

### Conceptual Mapping: `ragit` Modularity & Prime Numbers

Applying the prime-number-based decomposition to the `ragit` project structure, using a **bottom-up approach** to build complexity from simpler, more granular units:

-   **2 (Binary/Duality):** Represents the most granular level of modularity in `ragit`.
    -   A function and its corresponding unit test.
    -   A data structure and its associated `impl` block.
    -   Input and Output for a specific operation.

-   **3 (Trinity/Foundation):** Grouping 2s into 3s, representing foundational components.
    -   A module composed of a core data structure, its primary logic, and its I/O operations.
    -   A feature consisting of its API, its internal implementation, and its CLI integration.

-   **5 (Quintessence/Organization):** Grouping 3s into 5s, representing organized functional areas.
    -   A crate (e.g., `ragit-utils`) conceptually divided into 5 main functional areas (e.g., `path_utils`, `string_utils`, `chunk`, `index`, `uid`).
    -   The five core commands of the CLI (e.g., `add`, `audit`, `build`, `query`, `ls`).

-   **7 (Completion/Overarching Goal):** Grouping 5s into 7s, representing major functional areas or architectural layers.
    -   A major functional area of the project, like "Indexing," encompassing several related crates or modules.
    -   The seven conceptual layers of the `ragit` architecture (e.g., CLI, API, Core Logic, Data Storage, Schema, Utilities, External Integrations).

-   **... and so on, up to 19 (Periodic Structures/Iterative Refinement):** This represents the entire `ragit` project, viewed as a complex system composed of these hierarchically organized prime-numbered groups, reflecting its iterative development and the "Bott periodic structures" of its design.

## Operational Philosophy: Whistle While You Work (Meme Mining)

As a meme miner, we dig in the mountain of Plato for gems. We place each idea we encounter into the hyperspace and add it to the lattice. While we work, we constantly look for patterns to add value to the system.

### Current Refactoring Status:

The project now compiles successfully after addressing numerous dependency and import issues across multiple crates. All previously reported compilation errors have been resolved. For a detailed history of refactoring progress, please refer to `docs/refactoring_history.md`.

### Next Immediate Steps:

*   **Review and Update Documentation:** Review and update relevant documentation files (e.g., `architecture.md`, `index.md`, `uid_query.md`, `build.md`, `config.md`) to reflect the current project structure and resolved issues.
*   **Document New Crates:** Create or update documentation for newly created or significantly refactored crates, detailing their purpose, API, and usage.

**Important Note:** As per your preference, we will continue to avoid `cargo clean` and `cargo update` unless absolutely necessary due to long build times.
