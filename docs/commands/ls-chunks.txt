NAME
----
rag-ls-chunks - Show information about chunks

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag ls-chunks' [--uid-only | --stat-only] [--json | -j] [--abbrev <n=9>]
            [<uid>..]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Run `rag help uid-query` to read how uid-query works. If the uid is of a chunk,
if shows the information about the chunk. If it's a file, it shows the
information about the chunks of the file. If it's an image, it dies.

Instead of showing the full 64-byte uid, it shows the first `n` bytes of uid,
where `n` is set by `--abbrev` option. Unlike git, it doesn't use any
heuristics to guarantee that the abbreviated uid is unique.

If `--json` is set, it dumps a valid json to stdout. Its schema is,

- no flags: `[chunk: object]`
- `--uid-only`: `[uid: string]`
- `--stat-only`: `{ "chunks": integer }`
