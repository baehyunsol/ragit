NAME
----
rag-push - Push a knowledge-base to remote

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag push' [--remote=<remote url>] [--[no-]configs] [--[no-]prompts] [--quiet | -q]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
If the knowledge-base was created by `rag clone`, you don't have to specify
`--remote`. Otherwise, you have to use `--remote` option to tell ragit where
to push.

If you have created a new knowledge-base and want to push it, you first have
to create a knowledge-base in the server, then push the local knowledge-base
to the server. It's like creating a repository in github and push your local
repository to github. How to create a knowledge-base depends on what frontend
of ragit-server you're using.

If the knowledge-base in the server is private, you need an api key. You have
to set `RAGIT_API_KEY` environment variable.
