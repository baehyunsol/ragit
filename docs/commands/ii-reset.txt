NAME
----
rag-ii-reset - Reset an inverted index
rag-reset-ii - Alias

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag ii-reset'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
It removes an inverted index, if exists.

In most cases, you don't have to run this command. `rag ii-build` is
smart enough to know whether the inverted index is dirty or not. If
it's dirty `ii-build` will silently call `ii-reset`. If you just want
to disable the inverted index, just run `rag config --set enable_ii false`.
It'll disable the inverted index without removing it.
