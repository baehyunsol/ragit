rag-check(1)
==========

NAME
----
rag-check - Check whether there's a corruption in a knowledge-base

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag check' [--recover]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command checks whether a knowledge-base is corrupted or not. It's a quite expensive
command to run. In most cases, what you want to run is `rag status`, not `rag check`.

There are 2 use cases for this command.

1. When you have downloaded a knowledge-base and wanna know whether the knowledge-base
   is corrupted or not, run this command.
2. If you have implemented a new feature, which modifies a knowledge-base, use this
   command to check whether your new feature breaks a knowledge-base. If you're
   writing a test for your feature, call `rag check` frequently to see if everything's alright.

`--recover` tries to recover from a corrupted knowledge-base, without any loss of
information. It may fail.
