rag-check(1)
==========

NAME
----
rag-check - Check whether there's a corruption in a knowledge-base

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag check' [--recover]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command checks whether a knowledge-base is corrupted or not. It's a quite
expensive command to run. In most cases, what you want to run is `rag status`,
not `rag check`.

There are 2 use cases for this command.

1. When you have downloaded a knowledge-base and wanna know whether the
   knowledge-base is corrupted or not, run this command.
2. If you have implemented a new feature, you have to write a test. Use this
   command in the test to make sure that your new feature does not mess up
   the knowledge-base.

`--recover` tries to recover from a corrupted knowledge-base, without any loss
of information. It may fail.
