NAME
----
rag-summary - Get the summary of the knowledge-base

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag summary' [--force | -f | --cached]
'rag summary' --remove
'rag summary' --set <summary>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
It runs a summary agent and dumps a summary of the knowledge-base to stdout.
The summary is saved to disk and reused unless you edit the knowledge-base. It
checks whether the knowledge-base was edited or not by comparing its uid.

If `--force` is set, it will always run the summary agent whether or not there
is a cached summary.

If `--cached` is set, it will always use the summary on disk. If there isn't it
throws an error.

Run `rag summary --remove` to remove the cached summary. If there isn't cached
summary, nothing happens.

The cached summary is used by other agents. For example, `rag query` agent
might read the summary if it wants to.

If you already have a summary of the knowledge-base, or not satisfied with
the AI-generated summary, you can save your own summary with
`rag summary --set <your_summary>`. Having a good summary of the knowledge-base
is always helpful because other agents use it.
