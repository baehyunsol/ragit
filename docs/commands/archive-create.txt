SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag archive-create' [--jobs <n=4>] [--size-limit <n=0>] [--[no-]configs]
            [--[no-]prompts] [--force | -f] [--quiet | -q]
            --output | -o <file>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
You can create an archive of a knowledge-base. You can easily store and share
your knowledge-base. `rag pull` and `rag clone` also send and receive archive
files.

If `--size-limit` is 0 or not set, it creates a single file. If the limit is
set, it tries its best to keep each file smaller than `n` bytes. It behaves
oddly if the size limit is too small. Please keep size limit greater than 4 KiB.

By default, the archives do not include configs and prompts. If you extract
such archives, the knowledge-bases will have default configs and default
prompts. You can override this behavior with `--configs` and `--prompts` option.

By default, it raises an error if the output file already exists. You can
forcefully write to the file with `--force` option. If something goes wrong
while forcefully writing to a file, you might lose the original data. Be careful.

The created archive does not include inverted index. You have to run `ii-build`
after you extract the archive.
