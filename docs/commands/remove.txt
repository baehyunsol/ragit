rag-rm - Alias

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag remove' [--dry-run] [--recursive | -r] [--auto]
            [--staged | --processed] [--all] <files>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Run `rag help chunks` to read documents on chunks and files.

It remove files in a knowledge-base. You can list the names of the files, or
use `--all` flag. `rag rm --all` is like running `rag rm -r .` in the root
directory. The only difference is that `rag rm --all` does nothing when the
knowledge-base is empty while `rag rm -r .` complains that "there's no such file".

Unlike git, it never removes file in the file system. It only modifies
ragit's index.

If a directory name is given, it removes all the files in the directory
recursively. This requires `--recursive` flag.

By default, it removes all the files that are known to ragit. With `--staged`
flag, it only removes staged files and with `--processed` flag, it only removes
processed files. `--auto` is another filter. It removes a file in
knowledge-base if the file does not exist in the file system.
