rag-uid(1)
==========

NAME
----
rag-uid - Display uid of the knowledge-base.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag uid' [--abbrev <n=64>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
A knowledge-base has a uid. It's a unique identifier of the knowledge-base.
When you edit the knowledge-base (e.g. add chunks), the uid will be changed.

The uid only cares about chunks, images and meta. That means changing configs
or prompts will not change the uid. If you want to push a knowledge-base after
changing configs, I recommend you change its meta so that it has different uid.

Unlike git, it takes long time to calculate a uid of a knowledge-base. So it's
calculated lazily. If uid has never been calculated, this command will
calculate and cache the result. Then it'll use the cached data. When you edit
the knowledge-base, the cache will be invalidated and not calculated until you
need uid.
