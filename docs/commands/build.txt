NAME
----
rag-build - Build knowledge-base from staged files

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag build' [--jobs <n=8>] [--quiet | -q] [--dry-run]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Run `rag help chunks` to read documents on chunks and files.

This command reads files in the staging area and process them. Once it's
processed, you can ask queries on them.

It might take long time to build because LLMs have to read each file and create
index. This command regularly flushes the result (you can see that in the
dashboard), and when you terminate the process, the flushed results are safe.

`--dry-run` does not call LLMs, but gives you a list of potential file errors,
and how many chunks it will create.
