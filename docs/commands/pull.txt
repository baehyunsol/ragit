NAME
----
rag-pull - Pull updates from remote

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag pull' [--[no-]configs] [--[no-]prompts] [--quiet | -q]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
By default, it does not pull configs and prompts. You have to use `--configs` and `--prompts`
flags to pull them. If there's no configs or prompts in the remote, `--configs` and `--prompts`
flags do nothing.

Ragit is not a version control system, it's a knowledge-base management system. Unlike `git pull`,
you cannot redo `rag pull`. Once it's pulled, the original knowledge-base is overwritten with the
new one and you cannot revert that.

It only writes to `.ragit/`. It does not touch the raw data files.
