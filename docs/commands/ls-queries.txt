NAME
----
rag-ls-queries - List query histories

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag ls-queries' [--stat-only | --uid-only | --content-only] [--json | -j]
            [--abbrev <n=9>] [<uid>..]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Run `rag help uid-query` to read how uid-query works. If the uid is not of
a query history, it dies.

If you want to see a specific query history, run
`rag ls-queries --content-only <query_uid>`.

You can also continue a conversation with `rag query --continue <query_uid>`
command.

Instead of showing the full 64-byte uid, it shows the first `n` bytes of uid,
where `n` is set by `--abbrev` option. Unlike git, it doesn't use any
heuristics to guarantee that the abbreviated uid is unique.

If `--json` is set, it dumps a valid json to stdout. Its schema is,

- no flags: `[query: object]`
- `--uid-only`: `[uid: string]`
- `--stat-only`: `{ "queries": integer }`
- `--content-only`: `[[{ "role": "user" | "assistant", "content": string }]]`
  - It's an array of arraies because there are multiple query histories and
    a query history has multiple turns.
