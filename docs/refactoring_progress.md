# Refactoring Progress Summary

We've been systematically addressing compilation errors in the `ragit` project, primarily focusing on modularity and type consistency.

**Key Issues Addressed:**
*   **Orphan Rule Violations:** The main source of errors was `impl Index` blocks being defined in `ragit-index` instead of `ragit-index-types`. We've started moving these `impl` blocks to their correct crate (`ragit-index-types`) and adjusting imports accordingly.
*   **`Uid` related errors:** Corrected issues related to `Uid::new()` by replacing it with `Uid::dummy()` or other appropriate constructors, and addressed missing `from_prefix_and_suffix` implementations.
*   **Type Mismatches:** Fixed several type mismatches, particularly between `PathBuf` and `&str`, and `Vec<Uid>` and `Chunk`.
*   **`ApiError` and `TeraError`:** Resolved conflicting `From` implementations for `ApiError` and `TeraError` by ensuring correct imports and removing redundant error variants.

**Current Status:**
We've made significant progress in resolving the compilation errors. The current errors are primarily related to:
*   Remaining `impl Index` blocks that need to be moved.
*   Further type mismatches and unresolved imports that arise from the ongoing restructuring.
*   `TfidfResult` generic argument issue.

**Next Steps:**
1.  **Continue Moving `impl Index` Blocks:** Systematically move all remaining `impl Index` blocks from `ragit-index/src/index/` to `ragit-index-types/src/`. This will involve:
    *   Identifying the `impl Index` blocks.
    *   Moving the code to the appropriate file within `ragit-index-types/src/`.
    *   Updating imports in both the source and destination files.
2.  **Address Remaining Type Mismatches and Imports:** Continue to resolve any new type mismatches or unresolved import errors that appear after moving the `impl` blocks.
3.  **Fix `TfidfResult`:** Correct the generic argument issue for `TfidfResult`.
4.  **Iterative Building:** Continue to run `cargo build` after each set of changes to identify and address errors incrementally.

**Important Note:** As per your preference, we will continue to avoid `cargo clean` and `cargo update` unless absolutely necessary due to long build times.
