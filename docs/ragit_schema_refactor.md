# Refactoring Log: `ragit-schema` Crate (2025-07-21)

**Objective:** Resolve compilation errors and warnings in the `ragit-schema` crate, focusing on modularity and correct import paths.

**Key Changes & Solutions:**

1.  **Defined `FileSchema` and `ImageSchema` Structs:**
    *   `FileSchema` struct was defined in `crates/ragit-schema/src/file_schema.rs` with fields inferred from its usage (`path`, `is_processed`, `length`, `uid`, `chunks`, `model`, `last_updated`).
    *   `ImageSchema` struct was defined in `crates/ragit-schema/src/image_schema.rs` with fields (`uid`, `extracted_text`, `explanation`, `size`, `bytes`).
    *   Both structs were made `pub` and derived `Debug`, `Clone`, `PartialEq`, `Serialize`, and `Deserialize`.

2.  **Corrected `to_string_lossy` Usage in `image_schema.rs`:**
    *   The `image_path` variable, which was a `String` after `set_extension`, was explicitly converted back to `PathBuf` using `PathBuf::from(image_path.clone())` before calling `to_string_lossy`. This resolved the "borrow of moved value" error by cloning the `String` to prevent its premature move.

3.  **Resolved Type Mismatches in `file_schema.rs`:**
    *   `file_size` (which returns `usize`) was cast to `u64` using `file_size as u64`.
    *   `last_updated` (which was `i64`) was cast to `u64` using `last_updated as u64`.

4.  **Cleaned Up Imports:**
    *   Removed duplicate `use crate::ImageSchema;` from `crates/ragit-schema/src/image_schema.rs`.
    *   Ensured all necessary `ragit_fs` imports (`set_extension`, `read_string`, `read_bytes`) and `std::path::PathBuf` were correctly present in `crates/ragit-schema/src/image_schema.rs`.
    *   Removed unused imports from `crates/ragit-schema/src/file_schema.rs` and `crates/ragit-schema/src/lib.rs`.

This refactoring has significantly improved the modularity and organization of the `ragit-schema` crate, making it easier to maintain and extend. All compilation errors have been resolved, and the crate is now in a cleaner state.
