## Refactoring Log: `src/main` Module (2025-07-21)

**Objective:** Refactor the `src/main.rs` file to adhere to the "one declaration per file" principle, promoting modularity, readability, and maintainability.

**Key Changes & Solutions:**

1.  **Split `main.rs` into Submodules:**
    *   The original `src/main.rs` file was removed.
    *   A new directory `src/main/` was created.
    *   The `main` function was moved to `src/main/mod.rs`.
    *   The `run` function was moved to `src/main/main_run.rs`.
    *   The `find_root` function was moved to `src/main/main_find_root.rs`.
    *   The `handle_error` function was moved to `src/main/main_handle_error.rs`.

2.  **Updated Module Structure and Visibility:**
    *   `src/main/mod.rs` was updated to declare and re-export the new submodules (`main_run`, `main_find_root`, `main_handle_error`).
    *   Functions (`run`, `find_root`, `handle_error`) in their respective new files were made `pub` to ensure accessibility.

3.  **Resolved Import and Type Mismatches:**
    *   Added necessary `use` statements to `main_run.rs`, `main_find_root.rs`, and `main_handle_error.rs` for types like `Error`, `PathBuf`, `INDEX_DIR_NAME`, `Index`, `LoadMode`, `ragit_utils::string_utils::get_closest_string`, and `ragit_cli::underline_span`.
    *   Fixed the `ragit_fs::exists` and `ragit_fs::join` type mismatch in `main_find_root.rs` by ensuring `PathBuf` conversions.
    *   Addressed the `argument never used` error in `main_handle_error.rs` by removing the trailing comma in the `eprintln!` macro.

This refactoring significantly improves the organization of the main program, making it easier to understand, navigate, and extend. The codebase now adheres more closely to Rust's idiomatic module structure.
