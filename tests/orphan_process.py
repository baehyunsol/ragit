# Found a bug in ragit!
# 1. Main process spawns child processes and ask them to create chunks.
# 2. Main process is killed, but the children don't know that. They just keep creating chunks.
# 3. Next `rag build` spawns another main process. It runs `rag check --recover` before it starts.
# 4. Children from 2 finish creating chunks after `rag check --recover`.
# 5. `rag check --recover` from step 3 is supposed to remove the chunks created by the children from 2, but it doesn't.
# 6. `rag build` from step 3 creates another chunk for the same file. Now ragit doesn't know which chunk is from step 2 and which is from step 3.
