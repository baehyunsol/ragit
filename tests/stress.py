# Memo

NOTE: The test sample has 4583 files with 17095 chunks. It's big enough for a source-code RAG, but not for a general search engine.

- test run 1: first run
  - An inverted index makes `tfidf` 3.5x faster. It's nice to see that ii is working.
  - `build with incremental ii` is terribly slow. It's 3.98x slower than `build without ii` + `ii-build from scratch`.
    - It's likely because `flush_ii_buffer` is called too frequently. It's flushed per file, which means, it's called 4583 times.
    - `ii-build from scratch` flushes only 4 times.
  - The other commands run in sub-second. It's good enough for cli users, but not for library users.
- test run 2: with multiprocess build
  - Multiprocess workers are not as good as I've expected.
  - `build without ii` takes 4.65 times longer than the first run. It's likely because of the overhead of the workers.
  - `build with incremental ii` must have gotten better, which is what I've expected, but it hasn't. It's 7% faster, but it's not enough.
