# Refactoring Status Update

## Current Progress:

*   **`audit` command:** The `audit` command has been successfully refactored into submodules (`args.rs`, `output.rs`, and `mod.rs`) within `src/main/commands/audit/`. The `Audit` struct's definition has been moved to `ragit_api` and now correctly implements `Default` and `Deserialize`.
*   **`add` command:** The `add_files_command` has been implemented as a method of the `Index` struct in `crates/ragit-utils/src/index/index_add_files.rs`. The `AddMode` and `AddResult` types have been updated, and `Display` is implemented for `AddResult`.
*   **`ragit-utils` crate:**
    *   The `lib.rs` file has been reverted to a simplified state, containing only direct `pub mod` declarations for its immediate submodules and the `VERSION` constant. All previous attempts to split `lib.rs` into `partX.rs` files and `exports_*.rs` files have been undone.

## Current Build Errors (from the last `cargo build` output):

The errors are still concentrated within the `ragit-utils` crate and are primarily related to `ragit_uid` imports:

1.  **`error[E0252]: the name Uid is defined multiple times` in `crates/ragit-utils/src/agent/action.rs`**: This indicates a duplicate import of `Uid`.
2.  **`error[E0432]: unresolved import ragit_uid::query_helpers` in `crates/ragit-utils/src/agent/action.rs`**: This suggests that `ragit_uid` does not directly expose a `query_helpers` module.
3.  **`error[E0433]: failed to resolve: could not find uid_io in ragit_uid` in `crates/ragit-utils/src/index/ii.rs`, `crates/ragit-utils/src/index/index_chunk_access.rs`, `crates/ragit-utils/src/index/index_add_file_index.rs`**: This indicates that `ragit_uid` does not directly expose a `uid_io` module.

## Next Steps:

I will investigate the `ragit-uid` crate's structure to determine the correct paths for `Uid`, `UidQueryConfig`, `uid_query`, and `uid_io`. Then, I will refactor the import statements in `crates/ragit-utils/src/agent/action.rs`, `crates/ragit-utils/src/index/ii.rs`, `crates/ragit-utils/src/index/index_chunk_access.rs`, and `crates/ragit-utils/src/index/index_add_file_index.rs` to use the correct, fully qualified paths for these items.
