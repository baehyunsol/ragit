## Refactoring Status Report

**Date:** July 22, 2025

### Progress Made:

*   **`ragit-types` crate created:** A new `ragit-types` crate has been successfully created.
*   **Core types moved:** The `Uid` struct, `UidType` enum, `UidWriteMode` enum, `FileSchema` struct, `ImageSchema` struct, `ChunkSchema` struct, `Ignore` struct, `Pattern` struct, and `PatternUnit` enum have all been successfully moved to `ragit-types/src/lib.rs`.
*   **`ragit-uid` updated:** `ragit-uid` now correctly uses `ragit-types` for `Uid` and related types.
*   **`ragit-schema` updated:** `ragit-schema` now correctly uses `ragit-types` for `FileSchema` and `ImageSchema`.
*   **`ragit-commands` refactored:** All command implementations have been moved from the root `ragit` crate into the `ragit-commands` crate. The root `ragit` crate's command files now act as wrappers calling the functions in `ragit-commands`.
*   **`Cargo.toml` files updated:** Dependencies in `ragit-uid`, `ragit-schema`, `ragit-utils`, and the root `Cargo.toml` have been updated to reflect the new `ragit-types` crate and the refactored command structure.
*   **Placeholder methods added:** Placeholder implementations were added to `ragit-utils/src/index/index_struct.rs` for methods that were not found or had duplicate definitions, to allow compilation to proceed.

### Current Issues (from last `cargo build`):

*   **Unresolved imports in `ragit-utils`:** `ragit-utils` is still trying to import types from `ragit_schema` and `ragit_ignore` directly, but these types are now in `ragit-types`. This indicates that `ragit-utils` needs to update its imports to point to `ragit-types`.
*   **Missing `Error` type in `ragit-schema`:** The `Error` type is not found in scope within `ragit-schema`. This needs to be imported from `ragit_utils::error::Error`.
*   **Multiple applicable items in `ragit-utils`:** This error indicates that some of the placeholder methods added to `ragit-utils/src/index/index_struct.rs` are conflicting with existing, actual implementations in other files within `ragit-utils`. These duplicate placeholder implementations need to be removed from `index_struct.rs`.

### Next Steps:

1.  **Update imports in `ragit-utils`:**
    *   Modify `ragit-utils/src/index/index_struct.rs` to import `FileSchema`, `ImageSchema`, `ChunkSchema`, and `Ignore` from `ragit-types`.
    *   Adjust other imports in `ragit-utils` to use `ragit-types` where appropriate.
2.  **Fix `Error` import in `ragit-schema`:** Ensure `ragit-schema` correctly imports the `Error` type from `ragit_utils::error::Error`.
3.  **Remove duplicate placeholder methods:** Go through `ragit-utils/src/index/index_struct.rs` and remove the placeholder implementations for methods that are already defined elsewhere in `ragit-utils`.

After these steps, we will run `cargo build` again to check the progress.
