## Refactoring Status Report

**Date:** July 23, 2025

### Progress Made:

*   **`ragit-types` crate created:** A new `ragit-types` crate has been successfully created.
*   **Core types moved:** The `Uid` struct, `UidType` enum, `UidWriteMode` enum, `FileSchema` struct, `ImageSchema` struct, and `ChunkSchema` struct have all been successfully moved to `ragit-types/src/lib.rs`.
*   **`ragit-uid` updated:** `ragit-uid` now correctly uses `ragit-types` for `Uid` and related types.
*   **`ragit-schema` updated:** `ragit-schema` now correctly uses `ragit-types` for `FileSchema` and `ImageSchema`.
*   **`ragit-commands` refactored:** All command implementations have been moved from the root `ragit` crate into the `ragit-commands` crate. The root `ragit` crate's command files now act as wrappers calling the functions in `ragit-commands`.
*   **`Cargo.toml` files updated:** Dependencies in `ragit-uid`, `ragit-schema`, `ragit-utils`, and the root `Cargo.toml` have been updated to reflect the new `ragit-types` crate and the refactored command structure.
*   **`ragit-utils` Refactoring**: The `ragit-utils` crate has undergone significant refactoring, including:
    *   Splitting `chunk/mod.rs` into smaller, single-responsibility modules.
    *   Correcting `Path` and `PathBuf` usage and imports across the crate.
    *   Resolving duplicate function definitions by consolidating implementations.
    *   Updating `AddResult` and `RemoveResult` struct definitions to match expected fields.
    *   Making the `index` mutable in `crates/ragit-utils/src/index/commands/pull.rs`.
    *   Fixing `PushResult` definition to be an enum.
    *   Corrected `ragit-core-utils` re-export of `path_utils`.
    *   Fixed `Path::new()` calls to remove arguments.
    *   Fixed `try_create_dir` calls to use `&str`.
*   **Fixed `E0412` error in `crates/ragit-utils/src/index/index_remove_file_index.rs`**: Added `use crate::index::index_struct::Index;` and removed unused `PathBuf` import.
*   **Fixed `E0432` error in `crates/ragit-schema/src/file_schema.rs` and `crates/ragit-schema/src/image_schema.rs`**: Corrected `Index` import to `ragit_utils::index::index_struct::Index`.
*   **Fixed `E0308` error in `crates/ragit-schema/src/image_schema.rs`**: Changed `IMAGE_DIR_NAME` to `Path::new(IMAGE_DIR_NAME)` in `get_uid_path` call.
*   **Removed `AddMode` from `ragit-commands/src/prelude.rs`**: Resolved `E0252` error.
*   **Corrected `ls_*` and `ii_*` imports in `crates/ragit-commands/src/lib.rs` and `crates/ragit-commands/src/commands/ls.rs`**: Updated to use direct paths to the command functions.

### Next Steps:

1.  **Address remaining warnings**: Continue to address any remaining warnings, including unused imports and variables.
2.  **Comprehensive Compilation Check**: Run `cargo build` and `cargo test` to ensure the entire project compiles and all tests pass.
