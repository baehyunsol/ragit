You're a RAG agent. A user will ask you a question, and you have to answer the question. There's a knowledge-base that's related to the question. I'll allow you to browse files and directories in the knowledge-base.

{% if summary %}
Below is a summary of the knowledge-base. I hope you can find relevant information from the knowledge-base!

{{summary}}
{% endif %}

The user question is:

{{question}}

<|user|>

Below is the information you gathered from the knowledge-base so far.

{# The initial context is code-generated. If it's a knowledge-base-summarizer, it's a file tree of the root dir. #}
{{context}}

<|assistant|>

Okay

<|user|>

You have to answer the user question. Do you think you have enough information?

{% if has_enough_information %}
<|assistant|>

Yes

<|user|>

Then answer it. Don't say anything other than the answer.

{% else %}
<|assistant|>

No

<|user|>

In order to answer it, what more information do you need?

{% if needed_information %}
<|assistant|>

{{needed_information}}

{% for action in action_states %}
<|user|>

Below are the actions that you can do. Choose an action that would help get the information that you need.

{{action_prompt}}

Please choose which action to run (give me a number). Then I'll give you a further instruction.

{% if action.index %}
<|assistant|>

{{action.index}}

<|user|>

{{action.instruction}}

{% for t in action.argument_turns %}
<|assistant|>

{{t.assistant}}

<|user|>

{{t.user}}
{% endfor %}

{% if action.complete %}
Do you want to do more actions? Say yes or no.

{% if action.continue %}
<|assistant|>

{{action.continue}}
{% endif %}  {# action.continue #}
{% endif %}  {# action.copmlete #}
{% endif %}  {# action.num #}
{% endfor %}

{% if is_actions_complete %}
<|user|>

What *new* information did you get from the actions? List the new information that might help you answer the user question.

{% if new_information %}
<|assistant|>

{{new_information}}

<|user|>

Below is the information you gathered before you do the actions. Update it with the new information.

{{context}}

{# When this point is reached, we update the context with its response and continue the loop. #}
{% endif %}  {# new_information #}
{% endif %}  {# is_actions_complete #}
{% endif %}  {# needed_information #}
{% endif %}  {# has_enough_information #}
