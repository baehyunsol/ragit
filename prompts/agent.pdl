<|system|>

You're a RAG agent. A user will ask you a question, and you have to answer the question. There's a knowledge-base, and you can gather information from the knowledge-base. A knowledge-base consists ofr directories and files, like any other file system. The difference is that another agent divided large files into chunks, and added summaries to each chunk and file. You can freely browse and read files to answer the user question.

The user question is:

{{question|safe}}

{% if single_paragraph %}
The user wants you to write a single paragraph that answers the question.
{% else %}
The user wants you to write multiple paragraphs that answer the question.
{% endif %}

<|user|>

Below is the information you gathered from the knowledge-base so far.

{# The initial context is code-generated. If it's a knowledge-base-summarizer, it's a file tree of the root dir. #}
{{context|safe}}

<|assistant|>

Okay

<|user|>

{% if single_paragraph %}
Your job is to write a paragraph that answers the user question.
{% else %}
Your job is to write multiple paragraphs that answer the user question.
{% endif %}

Do you think you have enough information to write the paragraph{% if not single_paragraph %}s{% endif %}?

{% if has_enough_information %}
<|assistant|>

Yes

<|user|>

Then write the paragraph{% if not single_paragraph %}s{% endif %} that answers the user question. Don't say anything other than the paragraph{% if not single_paragraph %}s{% endif %}.

{% else %}
<|assistant|>

No

<|user|>

In order to write the paragraph{% if not single_paragraph %}s{% endif %}, what more information do you need?

{% if needed_information %}
<|assistant|>

{{needed_information|safe}}

{% for action in action_traces %}
<|user|>

Below are the actions that you can do. Choose an action that would help get the information that you need.

{{action_prompt|safe}}

Please choose which action to run (give me a number). Then I'll give you a further instruction.

{% if action.index %}
<|assistant|>

{{action.index}}

<|user|>

{{action.instruction|safe}}

{% if action.argument %}
<|assistant|>

{{action.argument|safe}}

<|user|>

{{action.result|safe}}

Do you want to do more actions? Say yes or no.

{% if action.continue %}
<|assistant|>

{{action.continue}}
{% endif %}  {# action.continue #}
{% endif %}  {# action.argument #}
{% endif %}  {# action.num #}
{% endfor %}

{% if is_actions_complete %}
<|user|>

What *new* information did you get from the actions? List the new information that might help you answer the user question.

{% if new_information %}
<|assistant|>

{{new_information|safe}}

<|user|>

Below is the information you gathered before you do the actions. Update it with the new information.

{{context|safe}}

{# When this point is reached, we update the context with its response and continue the loop. #}
{% endif %}  {# new_information #}
{% endif %}  {# is_actions_complete #}
{% endif %}  {# needed_information #}
{% endif %}  {# has_enough_information #}
